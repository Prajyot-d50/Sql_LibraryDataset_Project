# SQL LibraryDataset Project

This project demonstrates a Library Management System using SQL. It includes a complete relational database schema, data population, and real-world queries to manage books, members, borrow/return activities, and overdue tracking.

Repository Overview

This project demonstrates SQL analysis skills using a Library Management Dataset.
It covers basic to advanced SQL concepts, including:

Data retrieval (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)

Aggregations & Grouping (COUNT, SUM, HAVING, GROUP BY)

Joins (INNER, LEFT JOIN)

Subqueries, CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Temporary Tables

Stored Procedures

Data Updates & Modifications (UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER)

ðŸ”¹ Key Queries & Insights

1. Books Analysis

Retrieve book details (title, category, rental price).

Count total books per category.

Find most frequently issued books.

Identify books by keyword (e.g., %History%).


âœ… Insight: You can check which categories are most popular, rental price distribution, and demand trends.


2. Customer Analysis

List customers who havenâ€™t returned books.

Find registration trends (grouped by year).

Retrieve customers registered before a given date.


âœ… Insight: Helps track loyalty, late returns, and customer growth patterns.


3. Employee Analysis

Highest/lowest salaries.

Employees earning above 50K.

Count of employees per branch.

Custom procedure to find second-highest salary by position.


âœ… Insight: Useful for HR & payroll analysis, identifying top earners, and branch workforce comparison.


4. Branch & Salary Insights

Branch-wise salary expenditure.

Branches with more than 5 employees.

Top 3 highest-paid employees.


âœ… Insight: Allows branch performance evaluation and salary distribution tracking.


5. Advanced SQL Features

CTEs: Used to simplify complex queries (books issued by category).

Temp Tables: Store intermediate results (#lb_books).

Stored Procedures: Book_D (category-based price analysis), Salary_D (second-highest salary per position).


âœ… Insight: Shows you can handle modular, reusable, and optimized SQL code.
